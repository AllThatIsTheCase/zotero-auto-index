zotero-auto-index
=================

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://zotplus.github.io/auto-index/zotero-auto-index-0.0.32.xpi)) (**0.0.32**)

Automatically keeps your attachments indexed. Preferences currently have no GUI, but you can tweak them through
`about:config`:

* extensions.zotero.auto-index.delay (10): amount of time to wait after Zotero becomes idle to start indexing
* extensions.zotero.auto-index.reindexOnPrefChange (false): re-index all PDFs if you change the number of words to index

# Support - read carefully

My time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I
cannot accept bug reports
or support requests on anything but the latest version, currently at **0.0.32**. If you submit an issue report,
please include the version that you are on. By the time I get to your issue, the latest version might have bumped up
already, and you
will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and re-verify that your issue still exists.
Apologies for the inconvenience, but such
are the breaks.
