zotero-auto-index
=================

Automatically keeps your attachments indexed.

IMPORTANT
=========

Unless you have indexed your collection before installing this plugin, anything that touches any of your attachments
(including sync) will cause **all** unindexed attachments to be indexed. This will probably take a very long time, and
Zotero/Firefox will freeze entirely while it is running. This is normal. Go grab a cup of coffee, read that article you
have been putting off, and sit it out. After this initial spike, indexing should be painless and automatic.
